high priority
    * debug connectedness_constraint
    * think about cut graph which is defined by metric
    * primitives should not have duplicate vertices...
        * factor out the deduplication of vertices and move it to the preprocess stage

medium prioritiy
    * add ipopt
    * add path visualization
    * get rid of igl
    * write mkl wrapper instead of using eigen?
    * use imgui docking branch
    * images of color map
    * signal slots? Or better put everything into viewer, iteration times need to be better.
    * add serialization
    * implicit surface : fix normals + sample randomly to find multiple connected comp


low priority
    * add pbr shader and describe phases by varying material properties.
    * add background/tabletop
    * debug kd tree
    * figure out a way to have incremental geodesics (look into cgal implementation)
    * conan for package management?
